# Repository #git
In Git, a repository means a directory that is used as a root of project's files. (Almost) everything in that directory is included in Git version control - except files that are specifically excluded from Git in a *.gitignore* file.

A Git repository can be identified from the fact that it contains a folder named *.git* (a hidden folder).

When it comes to *Shell commands test suite*, the whole test suite vault is a *repository*.
