# Shell commands test suite
A quote from [Welcome.md](Welcome.md):
> This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault is designed to be a test suite for Obsidian's [Shell commands](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands) community plugin. It is assumed that you are already familiar with both Obsidian and the Shell commands plugin, and have used them for some time already.
> 
> This test suite serves as a standardised tool to make sure that each Shell commands version release is tested in a detailed process, and that the test results are stored in report files for possible later reference. Test reports might be needed for example in bug investigations in order to see if the testing process should be improved.
